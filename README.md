# Python Interactive Visualization project 
This repository includes python interactive visualization methonds by using plotly and dash package.

Plot types include line chart, radar chart, map, etc. 

Features include automatically refresh in given time, get data from database daily and live updating, hover around map to get detailed data, and connect with mapbox api to have a fancier visualization

The plot has generic feature, basically for the same type of plot, we just change the data source and apply some basic panads function then it works fine with a new plot. AKA template.
